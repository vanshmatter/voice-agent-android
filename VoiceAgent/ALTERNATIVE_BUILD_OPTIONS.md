# Alternative Solutions to Build APK

Since I cannot install software on your system, here are your options:

## ✅ Option 1: Online Build Service (Easiest - No Installation!)

Use **AppGyver** or **GitHub Actions** to build online:

### Using GitHub (Free)
1. Create GitHub account (if you don't have one)
2. Upload VoiceAgent folder to GitHub repository
3. I can create a GitHub Actions workflow that builds APK automatically
4. Download built APK from GitHub releases

**Advantage**: No local installation needed!

## ✅ Option 2: Portable Android SDK (No Installation)

Download portable tools that don't require installation:

1. **Download Portable JDK**:
   - [Liberica JDK Portable](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/)
   - Extract to: `c:\Users\HP\PortableJDK`

2. **Download Android Command Line Tools**:
   - [Android SDK Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools)
   - Extract to: `c:\Users\HP\AndroidSDK`

3. **I'll create a script** that uses these portable tools

## 🎯 My Recommendation

**Best for you**: Option 1 (GitHub Actions) or Option 4 (Portable tools)

### For GitHub Actions:
- I create workflow file
- You upload code to GitHub
- GitHub builds APK automatically
- Download from releases

### For Portable Tools:
- You download portable JDK + Android SDK
- I create custom build script
- You run script → Get APK
